I am not a serious photographer.

Nonetheless, on occasion I will take digital camera in hand and attempt to
capture something of interest with it.

Most of my published photos are on
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nateeag), and most of them are
available under a Creative Commons license (when one is not, it is
intentional).

In principle, I would like to reduce my dependency on SaaS products like
Flickr (though it is a good product), because centralization
[undercuts the power of the Web](http://redecentralize.org/about/).

That goal may never become important or practical enough for me to achieve
it, but towards that end, here are some photos of
[my son James](/photos/newborn-james/).
