  When I find time, I pursue several modes of musical expression.

  [comment]:(TODO Turn each title into individual essays?)

  ## Live Performance

  I play several instruments with varying degrees of success:

  * Piano
  * Keyboards (strongly preferring my Nord G2X and Nord Stage)
  * Flute
  * Electric bass
  * Acoustic guitar
  * Harmonica
  * Electric guitar
  * Upright bass

  [comment]: (TODO Find a better index of my sightreading abilities.)

  I can sightread a piano piece like
  [this Clementi sonatina](http://www.mutopiaproject.org/cgibin/piece-info.cgi?id=804)
  and carry on a conversation at the same time.

  With time, I can learn most piano compositions, though my classical chops are
  rusty these days. In high school I learned the first movement of
  [Schumann's Piano Concerto in A Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto_(Schumann)).

  On the other end of the musical spectrum, if a band is playing a song I don't
  know, as long as someone's yelling the chords before we hit them, I can play
  along without much difficulty.

  I have been in several (defunct) rock bands, and have also played in
  classical and pop orchestral settings.

  I learned upright bass primarily to play bluegrass, which I did for several
  years in my late teens.

  I have played quite a bit of worship music for
  [Hershey Free Church](http://hersheyfree.com/), and currently play keyboards
  for the worship services once a month.

  I have also played a fair amount of harp-and-flute duet music with my sister
  Hannah, at venues as disparate as
  [the Whitaker Center](https://www.whitakercenter.org/) and
  [the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire](http://www.parenfaire.com/).

  ## Arrangement

  I have arranged several pieces for harp and flute, as Hannah and I sometimes
  found ourselves lacking good arrangements for a given need.

  I was a primary driver of the arrangements in most of the bands I have played
  in, including Hershey Free's worship band(s), where much of my work is still
  in use.

  I did most of the arranging (and the piano and keyboard performance) on
  [Classical Academic Press's](https://classicalacademicpress.com/)
  [Veni Emmanuel](https://classicalacademicpress.com/product/veni-emmanuel-cd-ancient-traditional-latin-christmas-carols/)
  CD.

  ## Songwriting

  On occasion, I have been known to write lyrical songs.

  This usually happens as [parody](/music/songwriting/parody/) or off-the-cuff
  improvised lyricism, and little of it has been written down. Most of what I
  have written down is incomplete fragments.

  ## Composition

  I have an underdeveloped interest in composing instrumental music.

  In some ways, composition is a natural outgrowth of improvisation and
  arranging, and most of my 'composition' has taken exactly that form -
  ephemeral snippets of melody, harmony, and rhythm that were not captured in
  an archiveable medium.

  Of those that were recorded or written, many were lost in a hard drive crash
  years ago.

  However, [some pieces survive](/music/nord-demos/).
