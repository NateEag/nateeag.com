I have gone much of my life without an anthem.

[Paul McBride](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-mcbride-92a55b77) just
introduced me to [a song that might be
it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBcbDS5AGnk).

The idea of committing to tiny changes, life in the small, not needing to win
big or be killing it or have immediate results, but also of refusing to just
leave things as they are, to say "I can make that a little better and I will" -
that's so central to who I am and what I do, whether as an artist, developer,
church member, father, or husband.

Yet thus far it has made no appearance on my website.

I'm now trying to think about where it belongs in here.

There is Stranger Than Fiction, and "I just figured if I was gonna change the
world, I would do it with cookies."

Much of Sara Groves' work touches on this, and it's some of why I love her so
much. "The Long Defeat" is not exactly the same texture, but it is at least
tangentially related.

The same goes for Andrew Petersen - "Planting Trees" is about exactly this.
