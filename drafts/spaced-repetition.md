I am starting to use spaced repetition flashcards to help me store useful
information in my long-term memory.

I would like to store my flashcards as plain text, though.

Looks like Ankidown might be an option:

I'm slightly inclined to try Mnemosyne instead of Anki, just because it has a
mobile sync component that's totally open (Anki's mobile sync is not).

Ideally I'd like to keep the actual review data as plain text, too, or at least
be confident I can move it from one system to another.
