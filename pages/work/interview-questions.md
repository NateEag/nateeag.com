* How does your team handle asynchronous communication? How does the company as
  as a whole handle it? [async is important to enable deep work. If the answer
  doesn't recognize that, be wary.]

* I use Emacs, mbsync, and notmuch for email. Will that be a problem? If you
  use GSuite with 2FA, I just need app passwords enabled to make it work. [I
  really care about my email setup, and this also lets me find out how much the
  company controls individual dev environments]
