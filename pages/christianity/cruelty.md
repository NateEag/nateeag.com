I've interacted with several people over the course of my life who insist that
the God of the Bible is incredibly cruel.

In my experience and reading, that is not true.

Starting to accumulate some notes and thoughts on that argument here.

* The death of all firstborn offspring in Egypt is one that comes up sometimes.
  On 2020-02-23, I heard a sermon that made me realize something I never had
  before about the incident. The tenth plague is not just God flexing or being
  arbitrary. It's judgment on an entire culture for the slaughter of all the
  Hebrew male children by Pharoah and the tacit approval of it - the citizens
  and soldiers had a moral duty to stand up against it and (with the exception
  of the midwives) they did not.

* Deuteronomy 22:28 is a passage that does not fit well into my narrative, as I
  currently understand it. I should look more closely at it.

* Deuteronomy 23:15 makes it clear that "slavery" in ancient Israel is not like
  slavery in 18th / 19th century US. A "slave" who ran from his master is not
  to be sent back. It specifically says "do not oppress him".

* Deuteronomy 23:24-25 are interesting too. You can eat from your neighbor's
  vineyard and fields, but only with your bare hands, not with any tools. Very
  practical way to let people get a little food from the wealthier (or just
  while far from home, or on the other side of town) while preventing them from
  abusing the system.
