## Educational Goals

There are a few different things I want to teach my children:

- How to survive
- How to provide
- How to thrive

These are in something like ascending order - each one is a prerequisite for
the next category in the list, I think.

### Survival

For average humans in a functioning society, the core survival skills are not
too hard to learn; most can master them well before puberty.

Without a functioning society many of these skills become much harder but
remain

In descending order of priority, they are:

#### Breathing Oxygen

This sounds facetious, and it mostly is. We breathe autonomically and it does
not have to be learned.

That said, there are some things humans must learn to *not* do (especially
young ones) in order to continue breathing oxygen.

Off the cuff:

- not immersing the mouth or nose in water (before you have learned to swim)
- not wrapping the head in plastic or other impermeable membranes

There are edge cases where this skill gets difficult even in a society, such as
living in a space station or underwater, I imagine there is a raft of rules
that pertain to continued oxygenation of your blood.


#### Hydrating (Safely)

Humans do have to exert will to drink liquid, but it is a natural impulse for
us.

If we have access to a clean water supply, as most in a developed nation do,
this is as simple as using a cup to drink enough water to stay hydrated.

Without a developed nation to hand
