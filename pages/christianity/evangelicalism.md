American mainline evangelicalism and I have an odd relationship.

I grew up in it. I can see many deep flaws and failings in it.

Unlike most who can see that, I was not personally wounded by it and have some
strong nostalgia for certain aspects of it.

I could (and should) fill a book on the subject.

For the moment, I merely wanted to preserve something I wrote to a friend
recently, as I think it might repay further reflection.
