[Young-earth
creationists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism) should be
making efforts to end the use of fossil fuels.

If [the
Flood](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206-9&version=NIV)
is responsible for what geologists call [the Cretaceous-Paleogene
extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event),
then it is the probable source of the large coal and oil deposits humans have
been mining aggressively since the Industrial Revolution began.

At the end of the Flood narrative, [God promises to never destroy all life
again by a
flood](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+9:8-11&version=NIV),
[or by any other
means](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%208:21&version=NIV).

Given that, there will never again be such a massive injection of biomass into
the processes that generate coal and oil.

As such, the metaphor of [Earth as a carbon-based
battery](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/31/9511.abstract) still applies, even
if not for the reasons put forth in that paper.

If young-earth creationists want modern technology once the oil and coal
supplies run out, they should be aggressively pushing for renewable energy
sources. Once we're out of gas, we will no longer have the cheap energy to do
the grunt work of changing over to renewable energy sources. That process could
be done without power tools, but it would take several orders of magnitude more
time and human effort.

[comment]: (TODO Find estimate of remaining oil and coal supplies.)

A brief summary from the worldview's frame of reference:

God filled the gas tank then said that was it.

When it's gone, it's gone.

We should use what's left to stop using it.
