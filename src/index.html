<p>
    Nate Eagleson programs a good bit, plays music semi-seriously, and
    <a href="http://www.ishness.net">writes</a> from time to time. He lives in
    Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, with his beautiful and talented wife
    Stephanie and his son <a href="/photos/newborn-james/">James</a>.
</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>Nate makes tools that help real people solve actual problems.</p>

<p>Some software he has written or helped write is on the Web:</p>

<ul>
    <li>He wrote the cross-platform wxPython app for <a href="https://www.brightideaspress.com/">Bright Ideas Press's</a> Illuminations curriculum.</li>
    <li>He was lead developer, primary code reviewer, sysadmin, and all-around problem solver for initial development of 2x30.com (alas, like so many startups, it is no more).</li>
    <li>Some of his contributions to the world of open source software (and his slowly-evolving .emacs.d) can be found on <a href="https://github.com/NateEag">GitHub</a>.</li>
    <li>When he first learned JavaScript, he <a href="http://www.ishness.net/posts/js_tetris/">realized</a> the setInterval function implied in-browser games, which resulted in <a href="http://www.ishness.net/code/jstris/tetris.html">Tetris</a> (albeit a poor one).</li>
</ul>

<p>He has used several programming languages, most of which are listed below:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
    <li>bash</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Objective-C</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>Emacs Lisp</li>
    <li>Scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>
    He knows his way around XML, HTML, and CSS, but does not list them as
    programming languages, since they are not Turing-complete.
</p>

<p>
    He does primarily LAMP web development, but has been caught writing
    command-line utilities for *nix systems, writing cross-platform GUI apps in
    Java Swing or wxPython, and on very rare occasions playing with graphics
    algorithms or video game engines.
</p>

<p>
    He strongly prefers *nix environments - he has used Solaris, OS X, various
    Linuxes, and FreeBSD, and his desktop is currently OS X. He uses Windows
    only when software he is writing needs to work on Windows.
</p>

<p>
    Nate maintains some <a href="http://howicode.nateeag.com">notes on
    programming</a>, in hopes of passing on what wisdom he has gained during
    his fourteen years of programming.
</p>

<p>
    You can download his resume as an RTF
    <a href="/static/resume-Nate-Eagleson.rtf">here</a> (Word users, it should
    just work for you).
</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Nate plays several instruments with varying degrees of success:</p>

<ul>
    <li>piano</li>
    <li>flute</li>
    <li>acoustic guitar</li>
    <li>electric guitar (Telecaster)</li>
    <li>upright bass (bluegrass-style, and it has been a long while)</li>
    <li>electric bass (basic rock, and it has been a while)</li>
    <li>keyboards (strongly preferring his Nord G2X and Nord Stage)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    He is okay at synth patch design (which is why he is so intensely fond of
    the G2X), and tries to use primarily his own patches. He owes most of what
    he has learned about sound design to the incredible community at
    <a href="http://electro-music.com/">electro-music.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
    He uses <a href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a> on the rare occasions
    that he typesets music.
