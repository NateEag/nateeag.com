I am Nate Eagleson.

[comment]: (TODO Hyperlink for Christian.)

I am a [Christian](/christianity/). I believe that the Maker of the universe
loves me so much that He died to save me from myself. That belief is the heart
of who I am.

[comment]: (TODO Hyperlinks for 'husband' and 'father'.)

I am a husband to my beautiful, talented wife Stephanie and a father to my
children [James](/photos/newborn-james/), Isaac, and Maryn. I am a brother to
my three sisters, Hannah, Miriam, and Abigail, and a son to my parents, Bruce
and Mary Ann. They are a far better family than I could ever have asked for,
and I am eternally grateful for all they have poured into my life.

I am an artist and a craftsman. I love bringing new things into being and
helping them grow into what they should be. My primary mediums are
[software](/software/), [writing](/writing/), [music](/music/), and
[audio synthesis](/audio-synthesis/). Despite being

I sometimes dabble in [photography](/photos/).

[comment]: (TODO Hyperlink "teach our children" to a homeschooling page.)

I am a teacher. I love sharing what I have learned and helping people avoid the
pitfalls and mistakes I have made. I have taught music and software
professionally, while I help my wife homeschool our children as a passionate
amateur.
