I am fascinated by computer history.

Babbage and Lovelace are the start of it all, of course (unless you count the
Antikythera mechanism, which is a computer but not a general-purpose one - as
far as I know Lovelace was the first person in history to realize what
computation really implied in terms of automated algorithms being generally
applicable to a wide swath of fields).

Vannevar Bush's [Memex
concept](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)
is a fascinating concept for amplifying the abilities of individual knowledge
workers. In my opinion we still do not have anything that quite realizes his
ideal (though I did love [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/) for
years, and [other
options](https://srconstantin.posthaven.com/how-to-make-a-memex) continue to
emerge). It is worth noting that Bush's proposal [was not about digital
computers and that it built on existing technology of his
era](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/goldbush.html).
