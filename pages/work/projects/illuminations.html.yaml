  Illuminations is a homeschool curriculum with a large set of pre-planned
  subjects to choose from, so academic schedule planning for the year takes
  just a few minutes.

  The early versions were just sets of PDFs containing the daily lesson plans
  for each subject and a grid showing the weekly schedule for all subjects
  together.

  Customers loved the core product of pre-packaged lesson plans, but wanted
  some features PDFs couldn't provide:

  * a way to show only their selected subjects on the weekly schedule
  * a way to add their own subjects to the weekly schedule
  * a way to change subject order on the weekly schedule

  The publishers hired me to write an application to replace their weekly
  schedule PDFs and meet those needs.

  The result is a wxPython program that runs on Mac OS X (10.6+) and Windows
  (XP and up). The Windows installer is built using
  [InnoSetup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).
