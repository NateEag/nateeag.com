Here is a list of physical objects I would like to own.

own of these things are obscenely expensive and/or hard to actually buy. They
are listed because I am tracking things I would in theory like to own, not
because I expect anyone to give them to me.

* Physical CD of [Through The Deep, Dark Valley](https://music.theohhellos.com/album/through-the-deep-dark-valley)
* Physical CD of [Home In Halifax](https://www.amazon.com/Home-Halifax-STAN-ROGERS/dp/B000003BU3)
* Physical CD of [The World As Best As I Remember It, vol. 1](https://www.amazon.com/World-As-Best-Remember/dp/B0000004RU)
* Physical CD of [The World As Best As I Remember It, vol. 2](https://www.amazon.com/World-As-Best-Remember-Vol/dp/B00138D4UG)
* [The Gift](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Creativity-Artist-Modern-World/dp/0307279502)
* Standing desk (more research needed) [claimed by my wife for birthday, waiting on me]
* Good stool for sitting at standing desk (more research needed)
* Plastic carpet protector (to put under chair)
* More [ErgoDox EZ keyboards](https://ergodox-ez.com/collections/frontpage/products/ergodox-ez-original-standalone?variant=40172496643) (black, blank keycaps, Cherry MX Brown keyswitches)
* A [Moonlander](https://zsa.io/moonlander/buy) keyboard, which is basically a
  streamlined ErgoDox EZ
* [The Tao of Programming](http://www.amazon.com/The-Tao-Programming-Geoffrey-James/dp/0931137071)
* [Beyerdynamic DT 177x
  Pro](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-beyerdynamic-dt177x-go-headphones)
  headphones, to replace my dying DT 770 Pros
* [Continuum Fingerboard](https://www.hakenaudio.com/continuum-fingerboard/)
* [Continuumini](https://www.hakenaudio.com/continuumini/), as a much-cheaper
  (if less awesome) alternative to the Fingerboard. Only $700 (though really,
  the 4-octave half size might be a better middle ground because no limits to
  number of fingers it can detect)
* [88-key Nord Stage 3](https://www.nordkeyboards.com/products/nord-stage-3),
  since my 76-key is a bit too short, is missing a lot of awesome features from
  the latest models, and is starting to break.
* Nord G2X (backup/home copy, for when my current one dies)
* Nord G2 Engine + expansion card (again for backup and/or use at home; cheaper
  and easier to find)
* [Boss FV-500L Volume Pedal](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/FV500L),
  for use with G2 and Stage
* [The Writer's Glove](https://thewritersglove.com/) might help keep my hands
  warm without impairing my ability to type.
* [There Is No Cloud](https://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/chriswatterston/there+is+no+cloud+t-shirt+heather+blue-A108460005)
  t-shirt
* [The Ridge Wallet (aluminum)](https://gallantry.com/products/the-ridge-aluminum-wallet-cash-strap-black)
* [Maggard Razor Wet Shaving Starter
  kit](https://www.maggardrazors.com/product/budget-starter-kit/) with MR6
  razor, V3 head, Green Tea & Oat soap, and 10-blade sampler
* [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) looks like
  an interesting read.
* Any but the first two [Foxfire
  Books](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B00CJDHL4Y/ref=dp_st_0385073534)
* Any but the first two [Schlock Mercenary books](https://shop.schlockmercenary.com/collections/schlock-mercenary-books)
