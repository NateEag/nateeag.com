  I am not a great writer, but I am also not a terrible one, and I enjoy
  putting pen to page.

  I have a [growing set of essays on writing software](http://howicode.nateeag.com).

  I sometimes fail to suppress the urge to
  [write bad comic verse](/writing/poetry/).

  In a similar vein, [I sometimes parody songs](/music/songwriting/parody/).
