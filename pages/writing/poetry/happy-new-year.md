As an avid fan of [The Emporer's New
Groove](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120917/), I make references to it often
in day-to-day communication.

On New Year's Day 2020 at about 12:43 AM, my wife sent a message to
extended family that said, "Happy happy new year!"

My brain immediately leapt to the diner birthday song from the
aforementioned film, and this spilled out.

    A happy happy New Year
    From both of us to yoooou
    We wish it were not midnight
    So we could party too.

    A happy happy New Year
    May all your dreams come true
    Now go crash straight into your bed
    And don't get up till two.
