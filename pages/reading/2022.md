Here is the list of notable things I read in 2022.

* _Shadows In Flight_, by Orson Scott Card. The final book in the
  Ender's-Game-adjacent "Bean books". It felt like something of a coda, with a
  much less intricate plot than the previous books, and it was rather shorter,
  but it was a fitting ending, well-made. Started on the evening of January
  4th, I think, and finished around 12:30 AM January 6th.

* _Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrel_, by Susanna Clarke. An Austenian comedy of
  manners and character study, an alternate history of England during the
  Napoleonic wars, a fantasy, and a meditation on the eternal conflict between
  reductionists and mystics. A strong recommendation. I started it in early
  January and finished it January 23rd around 2:40 PM Eastern.
