Some insights I have come to on the subject of managing emotions healthily:

Confrontation and emotional honesty need to be decoupled for either to be
effective.

When they are tangled together, you are unlikely to say what you intended, and
what you do say is likely to be poor communication.

Further, even if you manage to be superhuman and say what you meant, your
emotional honesty is likely to make the other party not hear what you said.
Grief, anger, joy, excitement - all strong emotions color how we say things,
and that in turn colors what people hear.
