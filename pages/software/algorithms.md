## Gale-Shapley

This algorithm solves the "stable marriage" problem. It guarantees that after
execution, all participants are paired ("married"), and that no partner would
prefer to be paired with a different partner who would also prefer them (a
condition called a "stable marriage").

This is the algorithm used for the medical school matching process.

It has polynomial running time.
