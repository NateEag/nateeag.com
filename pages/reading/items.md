This is a dumping ground of things I've read.

I really ought to organize it into a JSON file, at least.

Somewhere I have a unfinished project to build a proper DB schema representing
the media I've experienced and hope to experience... :P

* The Oneprince, by Bill Hand
* Howl's Moving Castle, by Diana Wynne Jones
* Stories Of Your Life, by Ted Chiang
* The Heart of the Artist, by Rory Nolan (not that good)
* The Hobbit, by J. R. R. Tolkien (I love it tremendously)
* The Lord of the Rings, by J. R. R. Tolkien (one of my favorite things)
* The Silmarillion, by J. R. R. Tolkien [posthumous] (dense, tragic, and wonderful)
* Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, by Susanna Clarke (quite good)
* And So This Is Christmas, by Brian Bilston
* The Book of Heroic Failures, by Stephen Pile (gloriously entertaining collection of screwups, misses, and errors)
* The Tough Guide To Fantasyland, by Diana Wynne Jones (a snarky encyclopedia of fantasy tropes)
* The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage, by Sydney Padua
* The Frugal Wizard's Handbook For Surviving Medieval England, by Brandon Sanderson (revisit)
* Tress of the Emerald Sea, by Brandon Sanderson (revisit)
* After, by Bruce Greyson (revisit / footnote-mine)
* The Resurrection of Jesus: Apologetics, Polemics, History, by Dale Allison Jr. (revisit; closest thing I've found to balanced history on the Resurrection. Written by a Christian, recommended to me by an atheistic agnostic)
* Imagine Heaven, by John Burke. Interprets NDEs as evidence for Christianity. Not as bad as you might expect.
* Freckles, by Gene Stratton-Porter. Given to me by my wife on the first Valentine's Day after we'd met.
* Peace Like A River, by Leif Enger. A beautiful book about faith, miracles, the harsh brutality of humans and the life everlasting. (revisit)
* The Night Circus, by Erin Morgenstern. A lovely tone-poem of a novel in stark black, white and red, about battling magicians creating scenes of aesthetic bliss at the cost of lives to prove points about how to train students, with an unneeded last chapter.
