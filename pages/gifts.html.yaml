  Because I have a kind and generous family, every time my birthday and
  Christmas roll around, I am asked what presents I might like.

  Inevitably, I find myself uncertain until it is too late.

  I hope that this list of things I would not mind receiving will help resolve
  that problem.

  Some of these things are obscenely expensive and/or hard to actually buy.
  They are listed because I am tracking things I would in theory like to own,
  not because I expect or want anyone to give them to me.

  * Good office chair
  * Plastic carpet protector (to put under the office chair)
