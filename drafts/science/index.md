I am not a scientist.

However, the scientific method is very useful to me as a software developer.

I have Opinions about it.

I should try to explicate them here, perhaps.

First, science is fundamentally fallacious. It's a huge exercise in post hoc
ergo propter hoc.

Fallacies do not automatically yield wrong results. They just do not prove
things.

It is a terrible methodology for proving universal statements. "We've never seen
a counter-example" is not a sound proof.

That said, as one who did a lot of math in college, proofs are not easy to come
by, can turn out to be wrong even after they've been accepted for centuries,
and when correct may not say what you think they do. See Donald Knuth's quote
about "beware the above code; I have only proven it correct, not tested it."

Fallacies are often really useful, in fact - just don't make the mistake of
thinking they prove things.

So, science is about pragmatic experimentation and finding practically-usable
guidelines for predicting things ("Under what circumstances will this bridge
collapse?").
