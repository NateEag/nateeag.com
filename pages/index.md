I am Nate Eagleson.

[comment]: (TODO Hyperlink for Christian.)

I am a Christian. I believe that the Maker of the universe loves me so much
that He died to save me from myself. That belief is the heart of who I am.

[comment]: (TODO Hyperlinks for 'husband' and 'father'.)

I am a husband to my beautiful, talented wife Stephanie and a father to my
sons [James](/photos/newborn-james/) and Isaac. I am a brother to my three
sisters, Hannah, Miriam, and Abigail, and a son to my parents, Bruce and Mary
Ann. They are a far better family than I could ever have asked for, and I am
eternally grateful for all they have poured into my life.

[comment]: (TODO Hyperlinks for 'artist' and 'craftsman'.)
I am an artist and a craftsman. I love bringing new things into being and
helping them grow into what they should be. My primary mediums are
[software](/software/), [writing](/writing/), [music](/music/), and
[audio synthesis](/audio-synthesis/). Despite being
[avisual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia),
I sometimes dabble in [photography](/photos/).

I live in [Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania](https://www.etownonline.com/).
