             <p>
                 One of my projects at
                 <a href="http://www.clarkassociatesinc.biz/">Clark Associates</a>
                 was implementing the Avantco Refrigeration website, a digital
                 product catalog and warranty registration system for Clark's
                 Avantco Refrigeration division.
             </p>

             <p>
                 I took HTML/CSS mockups from a web designer and converted them
                 into clean, modular, database-driven PHP, using
                 <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> to manage
                 dependencies, <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a>
                 for templating, and some internal tools Clark's PHP team
                 had developed for use across our sites.
             </p>

             <p>
                 I generalized and reworked the CSS to handle varying amounts of
                 content, something the designer's CSS did not handle.
             </p>

             <p>
                 I used JavaScript where reasonable, to enhance form validations
                 and implement the few dynamic client-side features that required
                 it (like the scrolling ad banner on the front page).
             </p>

             <p>
                 Much of the site's content was pulled from a pre-existing master
                 database, so a real CMS would have added unnecessary complexity.
                 Thus, I implemented a lightweight management system that parsed a
                 CSV of the products to list on the site and populated the
                 database tables accordingly. Most of the complexity was in the
                 category system, which I designed and implemented.
             </p>

                 (Note that someone appears to have broken the images on the
                 manuals page since I left Clark Associates.)
