[Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) is a remarkable tool, and I am
grateful it exists.

It is also remarkable how many sharp edges there are in the developer
experience of writing a mobile application meant to run on iOS and Android.
It's clear that the makers of both platforms believe they can be profitable
without happy developers (and they're likely correct).

One day as I was battling with an iOS-specific detail for the hundredth time,
and grumbling about it to a sysadmin, the following quatrain appeared in Slack.

## A Summary Of My Professional Activities In The Year Of 2017

    People will think I am crazy,
    and they'll likely be perfectly right.
    Cordova and Apple and Google
    have made me lose sight of the light.
