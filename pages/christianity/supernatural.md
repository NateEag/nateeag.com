No, this is not about the TV show.

This is a place to dump notes on why I believe the supernatural is real, and
perhaps other observations about it as well.

(for instance, the observation demons have every reason to hide their existence
from skeptics, so you should never expect to see their existence be confirmed
scientifically. They're rational agents, not random phenomena, and if they're
widely believed not to exist, they have much more freedom to fulfill their
agenda.

Think about how hard you'd laugh at someone who tried to deny the presence of
foreign spies by saying "Well, I and thousands of my colleagues have run
surveys and never received a single response admitting to spyhood."

It's not a perfect metaphor, but it's hard for me to imagine a definition of
"demon" that does not include control over whether it manifests physically or
not.

If you grant that premise, then the metaphor works, I think.)
