I am thinking more about computer and display hardware lately.

Keeping some quick notes in here.


## How To Not Buy Smart TVs

I recently saw someone suggest that buying commercial displays is a viable
strategy for avoiding 'smart' TVs. Huge monitors fill a similar role. They're
more expensive, but that might be worth avoiding the insanity of having
computers in my displays (and the attendant spying).


## New Laptop

I'll need to replace my personal laptop soon - it's dying.

I'm increasingly confident I don't want to use Apple any more, not as a daily
driver. :(

The Librem 15 from Purism has good Linux support, hardware killswitches for
wireless connections and cameras, has been used for NixOS, and has an aluminum
body: https://puri.sm/products/librem-15/


## Family Media Machine

Our old phones are not really a viable answer for streaming media.

We mostly stream Netflix and Amazon Video - I have not found an off-the-shelf
device that manages to do both.

I'm therefore considering an IntelNUC machine with NixOS.

Bonus - could put emulators on it for our old consoles, like the N64, GameCube,
and even the Wii (Dolphin).

First step here would be to hack up a NixOS VM on which I can stream Netflix
and Amazon Prime. If I can get that working, I'd say buying a machine to host
that setup is a no-brainer (though I'd need to also build out a simple UI and
get a remote control of some kind working for it).
