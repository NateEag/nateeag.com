Here are questions about Christianity I wish I had answers to.

When I come to conclusions, I remove them and put those conclusions in an
appropriate place.

For questions about what the Bible says, my approach to finding answers is
simple, if time-consuming - I read it through and see. In some cases quirks of
translation could become relevant, but so far I have found little need to dig
into the original languages (though I do occasionally worry about not knowing
them, but that's its own rabbit-hole).

- Does the Bible say that eternal suffering is the final fate of people who
  reject Jesus?

  The end of Revelation sounds to me like the "second death" is a literal death
  and the eternal fate is to not exist any more, but I could see other
  interpretations, so I want to find other relevant passages and put together a
  coherent understanding one way or the other.

  Possibly relevant passages:

  - Genesis 3:22 - 24 (denial of eternal life by preventing access to Tree)

- When Jesus says "No man comes to the Father except through Me," does that
  imply you must know him personally to enter into His kingdom? I'm wondering
  here about Lewis' idea of people from other religions being saved through
  Christ despite not knowing who He is, as depicted in The Last Battle.
