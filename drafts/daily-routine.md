% Things I Should Do Every Day

What are the things I should commit to doing every day and/or measure every
day?

I've filled this out further and made it more precise in daily-routine.csv.

    awk -F, '{sum += $2} END {print sum / 60}' daily-routine.csv

suggests that I have about 30 minutes of margin in my standard workday if this
is the approach I take.

I suppose right now I'm getting that back by not sleeping, since I get more
like 5 - 6 hours a night, not 8. I also don't do everything in that draft, or
anything close to it.

So, gonna have to think about this one more closely.
