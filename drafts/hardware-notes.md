I am thinking more about computer and display hardware lately.

Keeping some quick notes in here.


## How To Not Buy Smart TVs

I recently saw someone suggest that buying commercial displays is a viable
strategy for avoiding 'smart' TVs. Huge monitors fill a similar role. They're
more expensive, but that might be worth avoiding the insanity of having
computers in my displays (and the attendant spying).


## New Laptop

I'll need to replace my personal laptop soon - it's dying. Nine years is a
decent run.

I'm increasingly confident I don't want to use Apple any more, not as a daily
driver. :(

The Librem 15 from Purism has good Linux support, hardware killswitches for
wireless connections and cameras, has been used for NixOS, and has an aluminum
body: https://puri.sm/products/librem-15/

The hardware killswitches are appealing, as is supporting a company that's
trying to make freedom-supporting hardware.

It has a USB-C port and an HDMI port, but the USB-C port is data-only, so
getting two monitors to work can be pretty involved:

Their 14-inch model, on the other hand, has a fully-functional USB-C port and
HDMI port, so it can just drive dual monitors without fussing. Maybe they'll
update the 15 to work similarly next.

Apparently you can get Windows 10 working on it without too much headache, too,
so I have a fallback option if I try Linux for a year or so and wind up wanting
to bail out.

The Penguin M3 might be another decent option. Appears to support Windows,
looks roughly like a MacBook (though I'll never have a use for that freaking
numeric keypad they all waste space on).

The Framework laptop is genuinely modular hardware, with an eye to letting you
upgrade and expand your laptop and swap out the hardware you need for a given
job. It's anyone's guess if the company will survive, but if it does it would
almost certainly be the most sustainable laptop I've seen.

## Family Media Machine

Our old phones are not really a viable answer for streaming media.

We mostly stream Netflix and Amazon Video - I have not found an off-the-shelf
device that manages to do both.

I'm therefore considering an IntelNUC machine with NixOS.

Bonus - could put emulators on it for our old consoles, like the N64, GameCube,
and even the Wii (Dolphin). Obviously a media library with rips of our DVDs
would be feasible too, as would some sort of photo browsing UI (Plex or similar
could cover both of those). Could use it for playing stuff from the music
library, too, maybe even dig up a mobile app for controlling that so we don't
have to have the TV on (use Bluetooth to broadcast to wireless speakers).

First step here would be to hack up a NixOS VM on which I can stream Netflix
and Amazon Prime. If I can get that working, I'd say buying a machine to host
that setup is a no-brainer (though I'd need to also build out a simple UI and
get a remote control of some kind working for it).

Next step would be to show some sane method for controlling the thing. Would
Steph be okay with a wireless keyboard / trackball combo?

...we wound up buying a cheap Android tablet with a Mini HDMI port. It
technically does the job, but is prone to stutter with all the streaming
services we use.

I have not given up on the idea of replacing it with something more general.
