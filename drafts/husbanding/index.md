I married Stephanie Eagleson (ne√© Rathbun) on July 22nd, 2012.

Here is what I promised her on that day:

    In the presence of God, our family, and our friends, I, Nathan, take you,
    Stephanie, with all your faults and all your strengths to be my lawfully
    wedded wife, to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, to honor and
    respect, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in joy and in
    sorrow, in sickness and in health, from this day forward until death do
    us part.

    With this ring I thee wed, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
    Spirit. With all that I am and all that I have, I honor you, until death and
    death alone should part us.

Marrying her was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Choosing to follow
Jesus would rank higher, and having children is right up there too.

For me all three of those decisions are tangled together, and it may be
incorrect reductionism to describe them as different.

Pastor George Davis performed the ceremony, and has also best described my
experience of marriage with the following question:

"What if God designed marriage more to make us holy than to make us happy?"

Also, too, I think of Andrew Peterson's lyric in _Dancing In The Minefields_:

"It was harder than we dreamed but I believe that's what the promise is for."

I hope to write down some of the lessons I have learned about husbanding in
this corner of the site. We'll see if I ever take the time to do it.
