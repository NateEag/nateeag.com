When I find myself wishing for a program and unable to find it, I put it in
this list.

When I discover one of these already exists, I move it to my [list of useful
programs](https://github.com/NateEag/useful-programs).

When I (help) get one to a usable point, I move it to my [list of
projects](/software/projects.html).


## The Audio Engine

I would love to have an open-source, real-time, auto-scaling audio DSP engine
for general-purpose hardware - something like an open-source
[Kyma](http://kyma.symbolicsound.com/) for arbitrary hardware. Discovering this
already exists would be spectacular, but since I have not yet found it, I [work
towards building it](https://github.com/NateEag/audio-engine).


## A Better (D)VCS

Git is a powerful piece of software with a poor user interface and a few
shortcomings.

I chip away at [designing a better VCS](https://github.com/NateEag/next-vcs).

Note that before I started thinking about redesigning it entirely, I planned an
[improved hook manager](https://github.com/NateEag/githooks.d) and a
[distributed code review system](https://github.com/NateEag/git-revue) for Git.


## track-time

I occasionally use [Watson](https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson) to keep track
of how I spend my time, but I think a significantly better command-line
interface for the job [is possible](https://github.com/NateEag/track-time).


## media-list

I care a lot about art in various media, and have in spare moments here and
there mapped out a data model for tracking works and makers I'm interested in,
and the times I've experienced those works.

Think of it as an [unfinished, over-engineered todo list for experiencing
artwork](https://github.com/NateEag/media-list).

In many ways it's more a playground for practicing data modeling and
experimenting with software design than it is anything I intend to finish.
