TODO Break this up into component essays.

## Educational Goals

There are a few different things I want to teach my children:

- How to survive
- How to provide
- How to thrive

These are in something like ascending order - each one is a prerequisite for
the next category in the list, I think.

### Survival

For average humans in a functioning society, the core survival skills are not
too hard to learn; most can master them well before puberty.

Without a functioning society many of these skills become much harder but
remain

In descending order of priority, they are:

#### Oxygenating Blood

This sounds facetious. We breathe autonomically and every other aspect of our
blood's oxygenation is beyond our conscious control.

That said, there are some things humans must learn *not* to do in order to
continue breathing oxygen.

Off the cuff:

- not immersing the mouth or nose in water (before you have learned to swim)
- not wrapping the head in plastic or other impermeable membranes
- not doing combustion in poorly-ventilated areas (yay for carbon monoxide)

Similarly, there are skills that do help you keep doing it:

- backfloating in water (in case of accidental entry)
- controlled breathing (useful in water)
- swimming (get out of water after accidental entry)

There are edge cases where this skill gets difficult even in a society, such as
living in a space station or underwater, I imagine there is a raft of rules
that pertain to continued oxygenation of your blood.


#### Hydration

Humans do have to exert will to drink water, but it is a natural impulse.
Newborns do sometimes need to be taught to nurse (James was hard this way).

If we have access to a clean water supply, as most in a developed nation do,
this is as simple as using a cup to drink enough water to stay hydrated.

In that context, all you need to learn is:

- cup usage
- faucet usage
- knowing when to drink more by urine color (optional; thirst mostly handles this)

Without a clean water supply maintained by others, staying hydrated becomes
quite difficult. You need to know:

- How to find water (required skills vary by biomes)
- How to judge water safety
- How to purify water (desalination, filtration, sterilization)
- How to store purified water (container construction, sealing techniques,
                               sterilization)


#### Sheltering

Sheltering is instinctive to a certain extent - it's not hard to come up with
hiding under a bush when it's raining.

There is a lot to learn here, though.


#### Eating

Humans do have to learn to eat. Nursing is fairly instinctual, but eating solid
foods is less so.

Furthermore, if you apply the constraint that you want eating to not kill you
unnecessarily quickly, there is a raft of things you need to learn, even in a
developed nation


#### Sanitation

You need to put your poop somewhere your food and water aren't, and you need to
make sure it doesn't contaminate anything else.
