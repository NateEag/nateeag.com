I worked as a software developer at Rite Aid from June 2005 (exact start date
lost to the ages) to April 27th, 2007.

After taking a lengthy drive around the American West, I settled in to [try a
startup](http://www.codeninjaz.net) with [Bob
Stouffer](https://www.bobandkellystouffer.com/) on September 3rd, 2007. I think
the only startup mistake we didn't make was taking external funding (a.k.a.
"debt"), and on January 31st, 2009 I threw in the towel (Bob threw it in a few
months later, and on May 2nd, 2009, codeninjaz.net, inc was formally
dissolved).

I worked freelance contracts from then until the end of 2010, doing everything
from web development to system administration to [working on a desktop app in
wxPython](/work/projects/illuminations).

On January 3rd, 2011, I started a long-term contract as lead developer for
2x30.com, a startup project to build a social network to help people make good
habits and break bad ones. After a long hard slog, we delivered the product as
requested.

Unfortunately, "as requested" was a pretty far cry from "minimum viable
product", despite our product manager's best efforts to persuade the board of
investors otherwise, and several months after I submitted my last invoice for
initial development (on June 29th of 2012), the project shut down.

I took a few months off to get married, honeymoon for several weeks in Ireland,
and settle in to married life, then started interviewing for full-time
positions. On October 1st, 2012, I started work as a web developer at Clark
Associates.

I was recruited away from Clark to do a contract as a front-end JS developer
for MapQuest, which I started on June 24th, 2014. A month after I started,
Brian McMahon showed up unannounced and said, in effect, "Hey guys, we're
closing the Lancaster office next year. If you want to move to Denver, CO, feel
free to re-apply."

After that earthshattering event, my contract wound up getting extended
through the scheduled office closing in March of 2015, but when most of the
employees left early, leaving the office a ghost town, my contract was
truncated at the beginning of January. I owe my manager Kumiko big for going
to bat for me and getting my contract extended a few weeks so I could finish
closing on my first house.

My last day at MapQuest was January 30th, 2015.
