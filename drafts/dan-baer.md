% The Greatest Correction Ever Printed?

I was sent a link to this gem recently:

I immediately became desperately curious how someone could swap Dan Baer's
actual job of "deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of Democracy, Human
Rights, and Labor at the U.S. Department of State" for the erroneous label of
"interior designer."

It appears that:

1) in the original piece, one of the friends with Chelsea is, in fact, an
   interior designer (search

   for "Dan Baer"), and

2) there exists a Dan Baer who is, in fact, an interior designer:

So, my best guess is that somehow the designer friend's gig got swapped with
Dan's, a fact checker confirmed with a quick search that, look, Dan Baer is in
fact an interior designer, and a legend was born.

I should turn this into a real writeup and post it - just wanted to preserve
the rough idea, and my conclusions.
