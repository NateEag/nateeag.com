For my own benefit and to help counteract my lousy memory, I want to start
keeping track of times I've seen God interacting directly with me, in one way
or another.

There have been a few events that were huge, sprawling, and would take twenty
thousand words to recount. I'm not worrying about them for now. They are the
deepest reasons I am a Christian, but I'm focused on trying to capture the
little things at the moment.


=========================
2020-02-13

I'd been having a run of several tough weeks both at home and work, during
which some of the biggest mistakes I've made as a developer thus far came to
light. Fixing them proved more complicated than I expected and it wound up
taking several weeks.

This morning, Mom was doing her "pray through the Psalms" algorithm per usual
and my verse for the day came up [Proverbs 14:4, my life
verse](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2014:4&version=NKJV).

It reminded me that I'm not defined by my mistakes and that mistakes are just a
fact of life - sometimes we will mess up, and that despite that, I'm still
valuable to my team and making useful contributions.

The odds of Mom's rotation through Psalms landing her on my life verse at the
tail end of a project necessitated by my own failures (after years of pretty
quiet, successful progress in my jobs), and it being exactly what I needed to
hear at that moment, well...

It doesn't seem a probable set of coincidences. I believe You set all that up on
purpose.
