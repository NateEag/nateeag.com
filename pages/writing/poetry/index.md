Although I am not a poet, I do have something of a knack for bad comic verse.

Inspiration often strikes while working on household tasks, such as
[laundry](/writing/poetry/laundry-hack.html) or
[baking](/writing/poetry/egg-whites.html).

Occasionally [writing software](/writing/poetry/cordova.html) puts me in the
mood as well. Sometimes it's a [dark mood,
though](/writing/poetry/job-destroyers.html).
