title: Useful Ballparking Formulae
meta_content:
  Sometimes I want to guesstimate something roughly but quickly.

  Here are formulas I think it's worth keeping in my head for that.

  I'll need to teach the site to render these reasonably. And also to offer
  links to each header.

  The main value really is being able to pull these into spaced repetition
  software (currently Anki), so my decks are version controlled. I might lose
  my review history, but not the raw data I chose to learn and remember, if I
  organize it this way.

## Area Of Circle

A = pi * r^2

(figure out how to use LaTeX for pretty formulas)

---

## Surface Area Of Sphere

S = 4 * pi * r^2

---

## Volume Of Sphere

V = 4/3 * pi * r^3

---

## Surface Area Of Cylinder

S = 2 * Pi * r * (h + r)

---

## Volume Of Cylinder

V = Pi * r^2 * h
