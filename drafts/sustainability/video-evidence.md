I no longer believe video evidence is trustworthy.

It's not completely worthless, but in any case of significance I now try not
to trust it on its own.

I should explain why here thoroughly.

I outlined this once on HN, and can clean that up and expand it here.

It boils down to "we now have deepfakes, they will only get better, and it's
conceptually impossible to make video hardware that guarantees 'approved'
videos must be true."
