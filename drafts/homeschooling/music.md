I am very, very grateful that my parents gave me a good musical education.

I would like to give my children one.


## Piano

We currently have a junky upright, acquired for $100.

When the kids are old enough to take decent care of a good piano, I would like
to get them the best thing I can for learning and enjoying piano performance
with.

I suspect that will be an electronic hybrid piano with an acoustic grand
action.

I've played a Yamaha AvantGrand in the past, I believe the N1X, and was
absolutely blown away by how convincing it was. As of 2022 they appear to
retail for about $9,299, so comparable to the price of a lightly-used decent
baby grand. You get the Yamaha grand action, so it will probably need action
work every few years. Much smaller footprint, though, which makes sense for us
cause we just don't have enough house for a full baby grand. The ability to
have them put on headphones to practice wouldn't hurt either.

A cheaper alternative could be the Nord Grand, but I suspect it would be too
digital.
