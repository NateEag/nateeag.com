I worked as a software developer at Rite Aid from June 2005 (exact start date
lost to the ages) to April 27th, 2007.

After taking a lengthy drive around the American West, I settled in to [try a
startup](http://www.codeninjaz.net) with [Bob
Stouffer](https://www.bobandkellystouffer.com/) on September 3rd, 2007. I think
the only startup mistake we didn't make was taking external funding (a.k.a.
"debt"), and on January 31st, 2009 I threw in the towel. Bob threw it in a few
months later, and on May 2nd, 2009, codeninjaz.net, inc was formally dissolved.

I did freelance contracts from then until the end of 2010, doing everything
from web development to system administration to [building a desktop app in
wxPython](/work/projects/illuminations).

On January 3rd, 2011, I started a long-term contract as lead developer for
2x30.com, a startup project to build a social network to help people make good
habits and break bad ones. After a long hard slog, we delivered the product as
requested.

Unfortunately, "as requested" was a pretty far cry from "minimum viable
product", despite our product manager's best efforts to persuade the board of
investors otherwise, and several months after I submitted my last invoice for
initial development (on June 29th of 2012), the project shut down.

I took a few months off to get married, honeymoon for several weeks in Ireland,
and settle in to married life, then started interviewing for full-time
positions. On October 1st, 2012, I started work as a web developer at Clark
Associates.

I was recruited away from Clark to do a contract as a front-end JS developer
for MapQuest, which I started on June 24th, 2014. A month after I started,
Brian McMahon showed up unannounced and said, in effect, "Hey guys, we're
closing the Lancaster office next year. If you want to move to Denver, CO, feel
free to re-apply."

After that earthshattering event, my contract wound up getting extended
through the scheduled office closing in March of 2015, but when most of the
employees left early, leaving the office a ghost town, my contract was
truncated at the beginning of January. I owe my manager Kumiko big for going
to bat for me and getting my contract extended a few weeks so I could finish
closing on my first house.

My last day at MapQuest was January 30th, 2015.

On March 9th, 2015, I started work as a contract JavaScript developer at United
Concordia.

I was told during the interview process that I would be trained in AngularJS,
the framework for the planned project, and that there would be two or three more
experienced JavaScript developers joining the project.

When no AngularJS training or real work materialized in the first few days
there, I learned it myself by cranking out a few toy projects.

When business plans changed a few weeks into my contract, I was moved to a
different project and told there would be no additional JS hires. Instead, I was
offered a student intern who had specialized in COBOL maintenance. I sighed,
added a thirty percent penalty to my estimate spreadsheet, and warned
management we were unlikely to hit their aggressive project deadline.

Fortunately, [Melanie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanie-durko-61197282)
turned out to be brilliant. I sank into teaching her front-end web development
and version control with Git while helping the new project collect business
requirements and review the data model plans.

My content-heavy mentoring style and her ability to soak up information like a
sponge paired well, and she performed beautifully. I did the heavy lifting of
building the complex UI components we did not have while she did wrote the UI
for the first phase of the project

TODO Explain some of the components I built and the constraints that made
building them necessary.

My last day contracting for United Concordia was September 12th, 2016.

My first day at Nxtbook Media was September 19th, 2016.
