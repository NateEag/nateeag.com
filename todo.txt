- Support backwards-compatible article renames by walking Git history and
  generating a table of 302s for inclusion in the nginx config for every
  rename. Obviously you'd want to cache the rename history somehow so you don't
  have to walk all of history every time you build the site.

- Use setgid in deployment infrastructure to stop having to sudo for every
  single deployment

- Use rsync instead of cp for pre-deployment copy job so it works even if the
  previous attempt failed or was killed

- Extract site source file watcher from how-i-code project

- Extract chrome-watcher.sh from how-i-code project

- Generalize nginx config for static sites with Ansible

- Add permalinks on page title header

- Add notes on what I like to work on and what tech stacks I like to work with.

- Add entry for Verse or Worse? I can't find the poems; not sure what I did
  with them.

- Move work/interests.html.yaml to software/interests.html.yaml

- Add base page for work history, with links to job summaries.

- Add project pages to expand on each project mentioned in the work history.

- Make links from "preferences" page to pages that comment on my feelings for
  and experience with the tech in question.

- Stop using absolute URLs for assets. I should be able to use relative within
  a folder, at least, and that would make renaming/reorganizing the folder
  structure easier.

- Polish JS Tetris and add it as a project

- Finish up James gallery (Polaroid look, lightbox on click)

- Add some of my OSS contributions as projects (skewer-reload-stylesheets,
  maybe web-mode auto-complete support, anything else?)

- Put up NoisePad + quick demo as evidence of my patch design efforts
