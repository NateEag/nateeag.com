One thing I'm puzzling over right now is how to preserve games I have a high
value for replaying or introducing my kids to.

Some that produce a lot of nostalgia in me have been open-sourced, such as
Descent (I & II): http://www.descent2.de/d2x.html

Classic console games can be emulated (and the best emulators are generally
open-source), though I'd need copies of the ROMs backed up somewhere. This even
works for GameCube / Wii games, thanks to Dolphin.

Old Bungie games might not do as well - possibly they could be run under
SheepSaver if I kept copies of them. Marathon is reborn as Aleph One, though.

I suppose my best bet overall is to build a Nix or guix machine that can play
the things I care about and keep backups of the data somewhere really safe -
Amazon Glacier, for instance.
