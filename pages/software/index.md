I make software that solves [real
problems](http://howicode.nateeag.com/hypotheticals-are-deadly.html) for
[actual users](http://howicode.nateeag.com/caring-for-users.html). I care
intensely about the [tools I use to do so](/software/tools.html), so I [think
of new ones regularly](/software/ideas.html) and [occasionally find time to
build them](/software/projects.html).

I enjoy teaching and mentoring other developers. I did not have a mentor when I
started writing software, so I learned many lessons the hard way. Helping
others avoid those pitfalls is extremely satisfying.

I spend a lot of time thinking about
[software development workflows](http://howicode.nateeag.com/category/workflow.html),
especially involving [version](https://github.com/NateEag/githooks.d)
[control](https://github.com/NateEag/diff-check),
[code](https://github.com/klaussilveira/gitlist/pull/259)
[review](https://github.com/NateEag/git-revue),
[documentation](https://github.com/thomas11/md-readme/pull/5),
and [tools](https://github.com/NateEag/skewer-reload-stylesheets)
[for](https://github.com/ejmr/php-auto-yasnippets/pull/16)
[web](https://github.com/smihica/emmet-mode/pull/15)
[development](https://github.com/NateEag/useful-programs/blob/master/wish-list.txt#L33)
[environments](https://github.com/fxbois/web-mode/issues/116).

I'm a big fan of [open-source software](https://opensource.org/osd). I do not
believe proprietary software [actually violates human
rights](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html),
but it certainly makes it easier for people and organizations to do that. I
also know too well the frustration of being dependent on a vendor for critical
changes. I therefore default to open-source programs and use proprietary ones
only when there are compelling reasons.
