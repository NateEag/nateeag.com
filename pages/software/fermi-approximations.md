title: Useful Ballparking Data
meta_content:
  Enrico Fermi was legendary for his ability to approximate things quickly to
  an order of magnitude or so.

  I wish I was better at it.

  To that end, I'm starting a collection of formulas, constants, and guidelines
  for doing the task.

  If this gets really big, I may wind up splitting it into multiple reference
  sheets.

  I'll need to teach the site to render these reasonably. And also to offer
  links to each header.

  The main value really is being able to pull these into spaced repetition
  software (currently Anki), so my decks are version controlled. I might lose
  my review history, but not the raw data I chose to learn and remember, if I
  organize it this way.

  TODO Write formulas and constnats up using LaTeX, so they can render prettily.

spaced-repetition: yes

## Area Of Circle

A = pi * r^2

(figure out how to use LaTeX for pretty formulas)

---

## Surface Area Of Sphere

S = 4 * pi * r^2

---

## Volume Of Sphere

V = 4/3 * pi * r^3

---

## Surface Area Of Cylinder

S = 2 * Pi * r * (h + r)

---

## Volume Of Cylinder

V = Pi * r^2 * h

---

## Pi

Ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

Pi ~= 3.1415926

---

## e

Base of the natural logarithm.

e ~= 2.71828
