I use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [heavily
customized](https://github.com/NateEag/.emacs.d), as my text editor.

When I'm not in Emacs, I'm usually in a
[bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) prompt in Terminal.app (or
[ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) if I'm on Windows). I have flirted
with using Emacs' built-in terminal emulators, but have not yet taken the
time to adapt them to my style properly.

My preferred desktop is Mac OS X, with [Slate](https://github.com/mattr-/slate)
for keyboard-driven window management,
[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) to remap a handful of keys, and
[Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en) to remap Caps Lock into
something more useful.

Version control is a fundamental part of my programming workflow, whether
solo or on a team, and my default choice is [Git](https://git-scm.com/). I
almost went with [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) when I first
made the jump to DVCS, but decided that Git's popularity was more valuable
than Mercurial's simpler interface.

I have learned enough programming languages to know that all languages are
equal, but some are more equal than others. In descending order of preference
(but not necessarily experience), I have spent quality time with:

* JavaScript
* Emacs Lisp
* Python
* bash
* Scheme
* C
* PHP
* Java
* Pascal
* Objective-C
* C++

When it makes sense (which it often does), I use relational databases for
data modeling. I've used a few different SQL DBs:

* SQLServer
* MySQL
* SQLite
* PostGreSQL

They all have different strengths and weaknesses, but on the whole I prefer
PostGres. MySQL gets a special shout-out for
[causing much suffering](http://grimoire.ca/mysql/choose-something-else), and
I recommend avoiding it.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) is my preferred
browser, both for regular use and development. It's primarily open-source,
includes an excellent suite of development tools, and is easy to extend.
