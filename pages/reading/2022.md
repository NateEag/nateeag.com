Here is the list of notable things I read in 2022.

* _Shadows In Flight_, by Orson Scott Card. The final book in the
  Ender's-Game-adjacent "Bean books". It felt like something of a coda, with a
  much less intricate plot than the previous books, and it was rather shorter,
  but it was a fitting ending, well-made. Started on the evening of January
  4th, I think, and finished around 12:30 AM January 6th.
