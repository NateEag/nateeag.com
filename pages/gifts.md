Because I have a kind and generous family, every time my birthday and
Christmas roll around, I am asked what presents I might like.

Inevitably, I find myself uncertain until it is too late.

I hope that this list of things I would not mind receiving will help resolve
that problem.

Some of these things are obscenely expensive and/or hard to actually buy.
They are listed because I am tracking things I would in theory like to own,
not because I expect or want anyone to give them to me.

* Standing desk (more research needed) [claimed by my wife for birthday, waiting on me]
* Good stool for sitting at standing desk (more research needed)
* Plastic carpet protector (to put under chair)
* Dual 27" monitors (<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043T34RK/>)
* Monitor arms for 27" monitors (<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00689HXI4/>)

  and easier to find)
