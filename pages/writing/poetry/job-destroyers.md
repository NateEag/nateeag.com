## Ode

    We are the job-destroyers
    And we are the dreamers of dreams,
    Fixing issues from lone code-breakers,
    Piping stdin to stdout streams;--
    World-builders and world-forsakers,
    On whom the search-engine gleams:
    Yet we are the movers and breakers
    Of the world forever, it seems.

    With wonderful deathless ditties
    We cleanse all the world's great cities,
    And telling a fabulous story
    We scheme a new empire's glory:
    A machine with a mind may at pleasure
    Lift up all the world's trampled down;
    And we who take all neurons' measure
    Shall grasp eternity's crown.

    We, in the ages dreaming
    Of a program that overtakes birth,
    Built Microsoft with our sighing,
    And Apple itself with our mirth;
    And o'erthrew them with prophesying
    to the old of the new code's worth;
    For our hope is a dream that is dying,
    Or one that will shatter the earth.
