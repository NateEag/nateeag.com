summary: MapQuest's JavaScript API for user-drawn shapes
description: |
             <p>
                 My first major project at MapQuest was the ShapeDrawingControl,
                 a map control that lets users define geographical areas by
                 drawing shapes on a map.
             </p>

             <p>
                 I began by assessing the existing code's state. Someone had
                 started on it in the past, but no one knew how close it was to
                 completion.
             </p>

             <p>
                 The existing code proved to be a semi-functional
                 proof-of-concept. It extended the ShapeOverlay classes with
                 drag handles, but was buggy, crash-prone, and did not work at all
                 in IE 8, one of the targeted browsers.
             </p>

             <p>
                 While assessing the ShapeDrawingControl's state, I discovered
                 several issues with underlying code.
             </p>

             <p>
                 The Maps API has three different graphics engines
                 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Markup_Language">VML</a>,
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>,
                 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element">canvas</a>),
                 and loads the correct one based on browser support.
             </p>

             <p>
                 Those three engines had huge swathes of duplicate logic, and past
                 maintainers had not kept them in sync. Each one had bugs not
                 present in the others (though some bugs were common to all
                 three).
             </p>

             <p>
                 Thus, I extracted the common code in the three engines
                 into a base graphics engine, then fixed the bugs I had
                 found.
             </p>

             <p>
                 I re-engineered the proof-of-concept for robustness and
                 correctness, and added support for IE 8.
             </p>

             <p>
                 I suggested, designed, and implemented several new features,
                 including the shape movement and deletion tools.
             </p>

             <p>
                 I wrote Jasmine specs for the new features, and wrote
                 documentation about the control for developer.mapquest.com.
             </p>

             <p>
                 Try the embedded demo below. It shows the control's built-in
                 behavior. A real website would hook into the control's
                 events to do things like only showing search results inside the
                 drawn shapes.
             </p>
