For many years I've been completely confused as to why so many people talk
about God "testing our faith".

It's a concept that has angered and confused me badly, as people seem to use it
as an excuse to not think.

I've usually encountered the idea from bitter ex-evangelicals or atheists who
were told this by parents, pastors, and the like, apparently as an explanation
for any questions that didn't have an obvious answer.

I had thought there was no Biblical basis for it, but I have discovered what
may be the source of the idea in Deuteronomy 13:1-3.

What it actually says is God is testing their love, not their faith, but it's
not entirely unrelated.
