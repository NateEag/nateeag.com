* How does your team handle asynchronous communication? How does the company as
  as a whole handle it? [async is important to enable deep work. If the answer
  doesn't recognize that, be wary.]

* Will I be able to use Emacs, mbsync, and notmuch for email? If you use GSuite
  with 2FA, I just need app passwords enabled to make it work. [I really care
  about my email setup, and this also lets me find out how much the company
  controls individual dev environments]

* What were the last three changes that shipped to production? Where did the
  ideas for those changes come from? [If none were features:] What was the last
  feature shipped to production, and where did the idea for it come
  from? [Should help show whether they're solving hypothetical problems]

* How did your last change get from proposal to production? Give me the gory
  details. [Should reveal the answers to: "What do they use for version
  control?" "What's their task tracker?" "Is deployment automated?" "Do they
  have automated tests?" "Do they do manual QA?" "Do they have CI/CD?"]
