I believe that the Maker of the universe loves me so much that He died to save
me from myself.

That belief is the heart of who I am.

I believe He has revealed Himself to man at various times and in various ways,
most notably by inspiring the various authors of [the Hebrew
Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh), by becoming the man [Jesus the
Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus), and by inspiring the early
Christians to write [the New
Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament).

If pressed for the details of my theology, I refer to the [Apostles'
Creed](https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/creeds/apostles-creed) and the
[Nicene Creed](https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/creeds/nicene-creed) as
summarizing it better than I can.

I believe the
[Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible#Development_of_the_Christian_canons)
is the Word of God, written by humans who were [inspired by the Holy
Spirit](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Tim+3%3A16&version=NKJV).
I believe it is true, beautiful, wise, trustworthy, and powerful. I am not
convinced it is [completely error-free in every possible
respect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy), because I can find
no passage where it claims to be so. Where it presents history I believe that
history is true, though not always in every detail - for example, whether the
centurion [came to Jesus
himself](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+8%3A5-13&version=NKJV)
or [sent a
messenger](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7%3A1-10&version=NKJV)
is a point of disagreement between Matthew and Luke, but that detail is not a
significant point in the story, nor is it the sort of difference that makes
historians disregard documents as entirely untrustworthy. As that suggests, I
am not a [Biblical
literalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_literalism), because a
lifetime of reading the Bible and many other texts makes it clear to me that
the Bible contains many non-literal genres, ranging from parables to aphorisms
to poems. The historical accounts were not written primarily for modern
historians, so interpreting them strictly through that lens seems unwise to me.
