An idea I want to refine and put somewhere:

Once a kid can do an action and can roughly understand the consequences of it,
as long as the consequences are not unduly dangerous, they should be
responsible for the action and the consequence. As a parent you can step
alongside them to help them with their response to the consequence, but you
should not protect them from it. They own their actions and you are just
alongside then because you love them.
