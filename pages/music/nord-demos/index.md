[comment]: # (TODO Link this to the work history entry Rite Aid)

Several months after I started my first programming job, I realized I was
making more money than I spent.

I wasn't quite sure what to do with it, but I knew I wanted to buy some
really good keyboards.

[comment]: # (TODO Tell the story of getting the G2)

So I did, in the form of a
[Nord Stage 76 (rev. b)](http://www.nordkeyboards.com/products/nord-stage-ex)
and a [Nord G2X](http://www.nordkeyboards.com/products/nord-modular-g2).

I fell in love with them, and recorded a few sloppy demos to show what good
instruments they are.
