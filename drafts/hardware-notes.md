I am thinking more about computer and display hardware lately.

Keeping some quick notes in here.


## How To Not Buy Smart TVs

I recently saw someone suggest that buying commercial displays is a viable
strategy for avoiding 'smart' TVs. Huge monitors fill a similar role. They're
more expensive, but that might be worth avoiding the insanity of having
computers in my displays (and the attendant spying).


## Laptop

In fall 2022 I acquired a Framework 14" laptop, with the 12th gen Intel CPU.
I'm currently using NixOS as my daily driver. I have a long way to go before
I'm genuinely happy with the OS (my macOS setup has been carefully tweaked over
a decade), but the hardware's serving pretty well, and I have been enjoying the
upgrade-safety the OS promises and seems to deliver on so far.

The Framework laptop is genuinely modular hardware, with an eye to letting you
upgrade and expand your laptop and swap out the hardware you need for a given
job. It's anyone's guess if the company will survive, but if it does it would
almost certainly be the most sustainable laptop I've seen.

I'm inordinately intrigued by the MNT Reform laptop, which is fully open
hardware, built with a blazing focus on repairability. You can pull out
individual battery cells. ARM chips, only 4 GB of RAM - it's definitely an
idealist's toy. That said, I think it might be an excellent first laptop for an
inquisitive, electronics-minded kid. https://mntre.com/ Paired with a
Lightphone, an older kid or younger teenager might have an effective set of
tools that aren't optimized for sacrificing them to The Algorithms.


## Family Media Machine

Currently a cheap Windows desktop with an HDMI out. I just bought one,
installed Chrome, and paired it with a Logitech K600 TV keyboard, which has
been working just fine.

At first I tried a much cheaper Macally Bluetooth keyboard and it worked pretty
poorly - insufficient range and flaky reliability.

In principle I'd like to replace Windows with NixOS, but I doubt it will ever
be necessary.

Ripping my N64 ROMs and Steph's GameCube cartridges and getting some emulators
set up would be a far better use of my time, I think.


## Replacement Audio Processing Headphones

I used to do a lot of heavy sound design and musical work, especially audio
synthesis.

My beloved Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pros have a flaky cable that gets worse with
each passing year.

I'd therefore like to replace them with either the DT 1770 Pro or the DT 177x
Go. Both have a detachable cable and therefore are at less risk for the kind of
damage my 770s have experienced.

It's hard to pick between them, as the 1770s are built for engineering (more
even frequency response) but have 250 ohms resistance and therefore require a
headphone amp, while the 177xs are tweaked for pleasant listening but have only
32 ohms resistance, making them workable directly with devices like cell
phones. Also the 177x is about $150 cheaper.

I'd probably lean towards the 177x, as it's more all-around usable, and if I
were ever taking audio engineering so seriously that I needed really precise
results, I could probably buy a second set (and maybe do more exhaustive
research first).


## Ploopy Thumb Trackball

I like open-source things, for repairability and sustainability.

I also like my thumb trackballs, as they distress my wrists far less than any
other pointing tool I have tried.

The Ploopy Thumb ticks both those boxes, so I'm inclined to get one next time I
need to replace a trackball.


## PQ Y28 Earbuds

Wireless earbuds are a dreadful source of e-waste, because in most cases the
battery cannot be replaced, which means consigning perfectly functional
electronics to destruction.

However, the PQ Y28s are designed to avoid that problem, by making their
batteries easily replaced and recycled.

They don't seem to be considered all-around great - people have complaints.

Nonetheless, sustainability matters to me, and these are closer to that than
most earbuds I'm aware of.

## Fenix BC26R Bike Light

Many modern bike lights have a built-in, non-user-replaceable battery pack,
turning the light into electronic waste after a thousand or so charging cycles.

Fenix's bike lights use a standardized replaceable 18650 battery, so that's not
such an issue.

The LED supposedly has a 50,000 hours runtime, which if you bicycle 2 hours /
day would last you ~70 years.

I'd rather have one with a user-replaceable bulb, too, but still - seems like a
good candidate for now.


## PedalCell

I took up bicycling as a form of exercise and potential transit in summer 2022.

I was inordinately intrigued by the idea of generating electricity via
bicycling, and thus did some research that led me to [the PedalCell USB
charger](https://pedalcell.com/).

It moves fairly easily between bikes, is cheaper than a dyno hub, and is more
efficient.

I'd never reach financial breakeven on charging batteries with it, so to justify
the cost of owning one I'd need to go another route, such as deciding I think
it's worth spending on for the coolness factor, or for having the ability to
charge electronics while on a long ride of the sort I don't currently do
(touring, bikepacking, etc).


## Family NAS Device

I would really like a NAS that can hold a large volume of data to serve as the
centralized, online backup for our various hunks of information (could start
storing optical disks in a different physical location to be fireproof).

https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2020-10-18-nixos-nas.html is a recipe for running
a NAS on NixOS. If I could get a chassis that hosts a good number of drive
bays, I might be somewhere interesting.

I recently discovered that you can find old rackmount servers for _dirt_ cheap
(I found one decent one for ~100 USD). One with four drive bays would make it
quite feasible to have a pretty large volume of storage space.

A good example is this place selling 8-bay Dell R720s at a starting point of
$105:

https://pcserverandparts.com/servers/dell-servers/poweredge-r720-server/

The R720 is a 2U server that's 29" and fits in standard EIA 19-inch racks. It
can get pretty loud when it's running hard, but NASes mostly don't run hard,
and if I rack it up in the basement, it wouldn't be that in the way regardless.

Could I hook up a TTY to it?


## Sanni Cartridge Reader

This would let me rip my beloved old N64 cartridges, thus letting me legally
play the games in future. More to the point, we could share them with the kids
(without worrying about paying for Nintendo Switch Online in perpetuity).
They're old and low-res, but James is curious and I think might enjoy them.

## Standing / Sitting Desk Setup

Thanks to Jared Worthen's recommendation when I started at ServiceTitan, I've
been using the wonderful [Husky 52"x24" adjustable height
workbench](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-52-in-W-x-24-in-D-Steel-2-Drawer-Adjustable-Height-Solid-Wood-Top-Workbench-Table-in-White-HOLT5202BJ2/311742117)
as a sit/stand desk. Paired with 27" external monitors and two of ErgoTron's
[tall pole monitor
arms](https://www.ergotron.com/en-us/products/product-details/45-295#?color=polished%20aluminum),
it's sit/stand desk bliss.

I have yet to find a good chair to go with all this, alas, nor have I
integrated a keyboard tray, because my sitting stool pairs with the desk well
enough to get away with in general.

I do want to get a decent chair and a keyboard tray, though, if only so I can
have a chair that works for playing my musical keyboards, and so I have a way
to quickly pull my computer control surfaces near aforementioned instruments.

Matt Guest tried this gaming chair and recommended it:

## Physical Teletype Terminal Project

I would really love for the boys' early years of computing to include some
hands-on time with a physical teletype-style terminal, if at all possible.

Seeing this glorious video (https://youtu.be/2XLZ4Z8LpEE) helped me understand
a whole lot of the ancient history of computing better than I had, and also to
understand intuitively how you could have ever used `ed` for programming. In
the context of an endless stream of physical paper, it's a really reasonable
design.

After I showed James a video of teletypes, he became slightly enamored of them,
too.

So, thinking about ways we could do this.

Apparently one is to buy an IBM Wheelwriter 1000 and build the board described
here https://github.com/IBM-1620/Cadetwriter to have your very own mechanical
typewriter terminal.

There is always, of course, the ridiculous option of just paying through the
nose for an ASR 33.

And there's Drew DeVault's line printer pseudo-terminal hack:
https://drewdevault.com/2019/10/30/Line-printer-shell-hack.html

There is also the social angle - maybe we can get in touch with someone who has
a restored teletype and arrange to try it out in person at some point.
Apparently https://mailman.qth.net/mailman/listinfo/greenkeys is the mailing
list to be on if you're hoping to pick up some connections for this kind of
thing.

...but aha. The elegant solution appears: TI's Silent 700 line of terminals.

They used thermal paper and a heating element, with acoustic couplers and
serial ports for communicating to computers.

The design makes them much more mechanically simple and robust than a standard
printing teletype (and also quieter).

As younger, simpler terminals, it seems to be fairly common to be able to pick
up mostly-working models on eBay for $100 - $200 USD.

If I can get a hold of a working model that handles upper and lowercase (some
do, some don't), then I could pair that with that NAS server I keep meaning to
build, and my kids could start off their computation education without screens
or any of the disruptions of modern systems.

I bet I could get James to play Zork and ADVENT for hours.

It looks like the 707 supports flipping between UPPERCASE and case-sensitive
mode (see page 29 of this manual [2-4 in the manual's parlance]).


## Physical Glass Terminal

I would sort of love to own a glass terminal and use it for hacking in Emacs
with all the horsepower of LSP and friends.

(https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term is the closest you'll get in
any sane way, and I kind of love it far more than makes sense [especially since
it doesn't support using Option as the Meta key {though I got Meta-x to work by
tapping escape promptly followed by x}])

The VT100 is the classic, but I thought it was worth noting that there actually
were multicolor terminals, such as the Wyse WY350 and WY370 terminals. If I
could get one of those I really could code like it's 1985 with the best tech
2022 has to offer (Emacs, evil-mode, lsp-mode, etc). Note that the terminfo
database on most *nix systems should make it possible to find most hardware
terminals that ever supported color. Apparently the VT-525 had color support
but required a separate external monitor.
