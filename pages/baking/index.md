I took up baking as an occasional hobby in 2022.

I have discovered that it rewards the obsessive attention to detail that
characterizes my work in software development.

I'm particularly interested in breads, though I've dabbled in cookies and
cakes.

### Sandwich Bread

I am working towards a routine of baking our family's sandwich bread, as it
would eliminate a source of plastic waste from our lives, and thus perhaps be
slightly more sustainable than our lives would otherwise be.

is the best recipe I've tried so far.
