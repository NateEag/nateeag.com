% Nxtbook Profile

While working at Nxtbook Media, I was asked to answer some questions
for a profile on the corporate website.

To my surprise, what came out the other end captured a lot about my
personality, taste, and values.

So, I've saved it here, just in case it ever disappears from the internet.
