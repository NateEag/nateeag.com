Just starting a list of media I want to read / watch / see / listen to at some
point.


## Almost The Truth

Documentary about Monty Python on Netflix.


## The Book of the New Sun

A book that's apparently either fantasy / SF, recommended by Brent Hughes,
whose taste often aligns with mine.


## Upload

Amazon original. Not sure if it'll actually be good, but the trailer looked
promising. Dark comedy about what the Singularity would actually be like (since
it would be run by Silicon Valley venture capitalists).


## The New Jim Crow

A book proposing that the United States has used mass incarceration to
effectively reproduce Jim Crow laws by labeling most black men as criminals,
then removing their rights by the justification that they are criminals.

## Neverending Story

Classic 80s fantasy movie I've never seen.
