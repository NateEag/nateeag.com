Here is the list of notable things I read in 2020.

* _Artemis_, Andrew Weir - finished 2019-01, day unknown

* _Permanent Record_, Edward Snowden - finished 2019-02-11 23:55 EST

* _Adorning The Dark_, Andrew Peterson - finished somewhere between 2020-01-01
  and 2020-04-01. I feel like probably January, but not sure.

* _All The Crooked Saints_, Maggie Stiefvater - finished 2020-03-02 00:33 EST

* _Redwall_, Brian Jacques (read-aloud for James - he loved it, cheered during
  the final battle, and immediately suggested rereading it) - finished
  2020-03-19 8:35 PM EDT

* [_Message Contains No Recognizable
  Symbols_](https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/g/mcnrs.html), part 1. It's not
  great writing, and I don't believe in software superintelligence, but it does
  a decent job of capturing in fictional form what it might be like to be a
  witness to the birth of a unFriendly superintelligence. I read this ages ago
  but had it come to mind and dug it up 2020-04-27.

* [_How To Invent Everything_](https://www.howtoinventeverything.com/about),
  Ryan North. Started this around my birthday or Christmas 2019, finally
  finished it up 2020-06-21 @ 11:17 AM EDT. A good installment in the
  bootstrapping civilization genre, though still not quite the volume I wish
  existed (it had a bit more practical detail than _The Knowledge_ in some
  places, but less in others).
